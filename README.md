**FPS boost**
- Dynamically changes user settings (drawings + tick) when low FPS detected. So instead of dropping performance in big teamfight we just decrease quality of drawings

**AimbotAIO**
- Prediction wrapper for all league of legends spells. Quickcast must be activated or it wont work.

**Namechanger**
- Changes your ingame name

**RajovanTracker**
- Gathers data for statistics (discord bot, usage, game patters), creates ftp connection and uploads data on the server at the end of the game.

**Spell_Library**
- Gets spells from riot api

**TrueWardSight**
- Drawing project to maximize the fps and ward real vision based on objects around it(bush, wall etc)

**champ_prio**
- Gets champion pritorities based on which role and subrole they play

**Tryndamere.lua**
- Trynda script recode because x64 stopped supporting it
